I write for the sake of growing routine and hopefully, discipline. Every day, I want to attempt to write something constructive / helpful or recreational.

The first thing I always want to stress about this site is this is not meant to be a place to flex about my consumerism: I simply appreciate having things in my home and on my mind. Ultimately, this is a place to express thoughts, feelings, and even go as far as helping someone with a stopper related to the device that I ran into. 

For documenting technology, there's always a day where I go to another computer or build, and the solution to the one thing I've done before is gone from my mind. The solution to this is to write.

For conflicting moments for me, there'll be a moment where I'll look back and know what I was thinking and feeling in these documents, but there's nothing better than archiving those thoughts. One day, I'll have better literacy for those moments and be able to troubleshoot them even further. This is what writing is good for.

For being mindful of the past and the future, being able to just merely reflect on the timeline of events; the discovery and owning of things, the hard times that occurred around, the good that happened too, the ability to see the advancement that I was hoping for since I was a teen, it all only reminds me of coming from a long way afar but with a long way to go. This is writing!
