	Chris Voia is a multifaceted artist who needed a solid way to present all of their work to their fans and future investors. Me and Voia initially kicked off to work on a rebranding project to help him get a consistent visual image that was more inline with a fantasy take on bustling transportation maps and urbanite living, but we decided that the most important thing would be to get him a custom blog, stylized in that same way to show at conventions he was being invited to.
	
	For this, I took on the project using Astro, which was useful for it's quick turnaround at building a fairly deep featured CMS system using Content Collections, and it's versatility in what frameworks are available to you for when Astro's client side components aren't enough for a feature or functionality, this being the Modal component which is built using React & SASS.
