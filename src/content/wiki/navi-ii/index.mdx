	This laptop was offered to me by a good friend after hearing about some trouble I ran into finding a reliable device. It'll be cherished for very long not only for the principal, but also because it's a strong machine for web development and music production on Linux. The perfect size, and a fine spec.

	This laptop can also fold. The Yoga name is (or was) for laptops by Lenovo that are able to be converted into a tablet. You be your own judge, but I find it neat to use for watching long videos and for music production, with my only issue being that the keyboard will be exposed from behind, which looks funny. The display transform function works on Gnome, <a class="highlight-link" href="">but needs your own input on Hyprland.</a>
	
	# Possible Changes
	* Why not build an install script that reinstalls every program I use here?
