# To Do List

TODO: There is a much better way to format arrays in markdown posts than adding commas inside the values. They work for now, but I want most things to be programmatic.
TODO: Please finalize a stylesheet naming convention and clean it up. "small-picture" and "img-util" both exist and don't make sense. Don't repeat things twice.
TODO: Parse all dates into 'Month YEAR' format.
TODO: Convert all pixel units to resizable units

IDEA: Turn the front page data getters into objects that can be revealed on conditions. I.e: If a post is more than a specific amount of months old, don't show it, and if no articles are above the threshold, hide the component. It's a logic exercise.
IDEA: For the menu / sidebar, make a tooltip that appears for clickable anchor links that link to an article.
Ideal functionality - Mouse hovers over anchor - Tool tip scales up to reveal tooltip content, the animation's motion is limited by steps. - Tool tip follows the mouse - Mouse moves out of anchor - Content disappears and the tool tip scales down with the same animation style but reverse. The tool tip should not follow the mouse when it's scale down animation is played.

NOTE: It's a little nonsense that the ASCII containers take in SVGs instead of straight text.
