# To Do List

TODO: There is a much better way to format arrays in markdown posts than adding commas inside the values. They work for now, but I want most things to be programmatic.
TODO: Please finalize a stylesheet naming convention and clean it up. "small-picture" and "img-util" both exist and don't make sense. Don't repeat things twice.
TODO: Parse all dates into 'Month YEAR' format.
TODO: Convert all pixel units to resizable units

IDEA: Turn the front page data getters into objects that can be revealed on conditions.
NOTE: It's a little nonsense that the ASCII containers take in SVGs instead of straight text.
